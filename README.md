chorrent
=========

A torrent client project as a chrome extension. The main focus is to have a sleek and clean UI design, being cross-platform and having extensive configuration options for power users.

#### :star: You can 'Watch' to be notified of the news and development status. Give a star for moral support (I haven't decided if this will be useful or not so Stars will decide if this project gets completed or not).

This chrome app is meant to be written in pure javascript, which means it will be cross-platform and will run anywhere that chrome runs. (most of the extensions I have seen, doesn't care about Linux somehow although torrent is constantly used, and like it is not enough, one also requires external application to be set up).

Looking forward for pull requests, especially about artwork and ui design.
